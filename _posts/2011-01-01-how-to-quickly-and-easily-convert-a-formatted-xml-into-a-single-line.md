So youâ€™ve got a nicely formatted XML object, with all your indentation setup so that it is easy to read. However there may come a time when you need that lovely XML to be formatted to a single line.

You could post it into notepad and manually format it, however this becomes quite a chore when your XML object grows. There is a much simpler method!

All you need to do is to copy your XML, and paste it into the Google search bar in the top right hand corner of your Firefox browser (this may also work in other browsers). Then re-copy it and paste it into notepad, voila, it should be all on one line.

No need for complex scripts, just throw it into the search bar and re-copy it back out.

Simples.
