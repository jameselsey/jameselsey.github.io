So, I’ve decided to have a go at linux from scratch, which should satisfy a good headache for the next year or so, possibly longer.

Checkout : [linuxfromscratch.org](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) Or have a quick read of the [Wiki ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch)entry

At this moment, I’m not quite sure as to what I’ll tailor my distro to, possibly gaming or a Windows like replacement
