I've had this website going since being a university student in the mid 2000s, it started off as a static html web page that I maintained myself (hey, I was fresh into web development and enjoyed the challenge!).

Later on I purchased some hosting and installed a Wordpress LAMP server which I ran for many years, after moving to Australia I looked for alternatives, and migrated it to AWS Lightsail. I haven't been too keen on the setup for a while now, it felt like I was spending too much time keeping WP up to date, fixing plugins, dealing with spam comments, and finding that older posts suddenly started displaying incorrectly.

I stumbled upon Jekyll and decided to give it a go! I'm looking forward to trying the [WP-Jekyll migration tools](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/) to bring across my older posts.
