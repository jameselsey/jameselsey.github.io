After recently sitting a course and exam for [ITIL v3 Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library), I thought it would be a good idea to reflect on some of the topics covered while they are fresh on my mind, and to also provide good future references.

I will try to cover the topics the exam requires you to know in order to pass, Iâ€™ll try to write an easy to understand guide, as when I was researching for specifics I was often overloaded with information and found it quite difficult to understand, hopefully I can target those that want a quick and brief introduction.
