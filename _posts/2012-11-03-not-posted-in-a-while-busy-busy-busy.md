Hi folks,

It’s been a little while since I made any detailed posts, and it’s not through lack of wanting. I’ve been pretty busy with a new project at work, and I’m also preparing to (finally) sit my SCJP at the end of November, so I haven’t had any time to write any android tutorials.

As ever, my “to do list” is massively increasing, I have a BIG Grails/Groovy personal project coming up after my SCJP, which will be a Grails web app, along with an android mobile client, with some QR code functionality and social integration added into the mix, so I’ll have plenty of interesting things to blog about in the coming winter months.

I’ve recently spent a lot of time working with IBM Worklight, so expect something on that, I also have ideas floating around in my head for Objective-C, C++, Python, MongoDB, Spring, more Android stuff, and covering off some of the iOS stuff I worked on over the summer.

So much to do, so little time…
