I have been a software engineer since 2007, I was fortunate to start with some fantastic mentors, and over the years have worked with some amazing people on some really successful projects. I enjoy what I do and love to solve problems, this site is a collection of ideas and solutions I've picked up over the years, hopefully it helps my fellow engineers!

I like to keep myself busy, when not behind a keyboard I train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and live semi-off grid on acreage in rural Victoria, Australia. I am also a volunteer firefighter at my local CFA brigade.
